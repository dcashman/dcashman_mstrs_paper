\textit{A lack of entropy gathering devices on some headless and embedded Linux systems has led to an early window during booting wherin values produced by the Linux PRNG are more easily predicted.  We identify and describe four sources of randomness in the kernel, including the Linux PRNG. We also identify an unaccounted source of entropy due to variation in request ordering of the Linux PRNG non-blocking pool.  Finally, we perform an analysis of the security level of four kernel-based security mechanisms dependent on random values: TCP sequence numbers, UDP source ports, stack canaries and ASLR.  We conclude that good random values should be a system responsibility and that the current design of sources providing random values should be consolidated and changed to reflect a more practical threat model.}
